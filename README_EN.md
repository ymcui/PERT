Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become an important technique in natural language processing. In the past two years, the Joint Laboratory of HIT and iFLYTEK Research (HFL) has released a variety of Chinese pre-training model resources and related toolkits. As a continuation of related work, in this project, we propose a pre-trained model (PERT) based on permuted language model (PerLM) to learn text semantic information in a self-supervised manner without introducing the mask tokens [MASK]. The experimental results show that PERT yields both positive and negative performance on a wide range of Chinese and English NLU tasks. We release Chinese and English PERT (base-level and large-level) to our community.

## Introduction
The learning of pre-trained models for natural language understanding (NLU) falls broadly into two categories: input text with or without the masking token [MASK]. 

The main motivation of this work is quite interesting, which is based on a usual phenomenon: a certain degree of permuted text does not affect comprehension. So is it possible to learn semantic knowledge from the permuted text?

General idea: PERT utilizes permuted text as the input  (so no [MASK] tokens are introduced). The learning objective of PERT is to predict the location of the original token. Please take a look at the following example.

### Original Download (TF version)

The model weights of TensorFlow 1.15 are mainly provided here. For models in PyTorch or TensorFlow2, see the next section.

**The open source version only contains the weights of the Transformer part, which can be directly used for fine-tuning of downstream tasks. Also you can further pre-train this model with any pre-training objective as long as it uses traditional transformer architecture as the main body. For more instructions, see FAQ.**

Take the TensorFlow version of `Chinese-PERT-base` as an example. The zip archive contains the following files:

````
chinese_pert_base_L-12_H-768_A-12.zip
    |- pert_model.ckpt # model weights
    |- pert_model.meta # model meta information
    |- pert_model.index # model index information
    |- pert_config.json # model parameters
    |- vocab.txt # Vocabulary (same as original vocabulary of Google's BERT-base-Chinese)
````

Among them, `bert_config.json` and `vocab.txt` are exactly the same as Google's original `BERT-base, Chinese` (the English version is the same as the BERT-uncased version).

## Quick Load
Since the main body of PERT is still the same as the BERT structure, users can easily call the PERT model using the [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

**Note: All PERT models in this project should be loaded by using BertTokenizer and BertModel (BertForQuestionAnswering for MRC models). **

````python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("MODEL_NAME")
model = BertModel.from_pretrained("MODEL_NAME")
````
The list of `MODEL_NAME` is as follows:

| Model name         | MODEL_NAME             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Chinese-PERT-large | hfl/chinese-pert-large |
| Chinese-PERT-base  | hfl/chinese-pert-base  |
| Chinese-PERT-large-MRC | hfl/chinese-pert-large-mrc |
| Chinese-PERT-base-MRC  | hfl/chinese-pert-base-mrc  |
| English-PERT-large | hfl/english-pert-large |
| English-PERT-base  | hfl/english-pert-base  |

## FAQ
**Q1: About the open-source version of PERT**  
A1: The open source version only contains the weights of the Transformer part, which can be directly used for fine-tuning of downstream tasks, or for the initialization of re-pre-training for other models. The original TF version weights may contain **randomly initialized** MLM weights (Please do not try to use these part). There are two reasons:

- To remove unnecessary Adam-related weights (the model size will be shrinked to its 1/3);
- Consistent with the BERT model conversion of transformers (this process will use the original BERT structure, so the weights of the pre-training task part will be lost, and the MLM random initialization weights of BERT will be retained).

**Q2: About the effect of PERT on downstream tasks**  
A2: The preliminary conclusion is that the effect is better in tasks such as reading comprehension and sequence labeling, but the effect is poor in text classification tasks. Please try the specific effects on your own tasks. For more information, please read our paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06906
